# moarArt
A Starbound mod.
Adds a little bit of class to an otherwise classless character.

Import into your Starbound mods directory and enjoy!

To do:
  - Add art to treasure pools
  - MOAR moar Art (dali, pollock, murakami)
  - resize paintings to true-to-piece size (or something that makes sense in game)


Licensing for all art falls under fair use, as it is too pixelated to reproduce.. it's also all a big joke. ha.
