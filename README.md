Hello everyone! Here is a mod that I've been working on for a while. I will be adding a lot more to it very soon, but I thought that I would share it will you all to get some feedback!

What it has so far:

HAL: A wall mounted A.I. that spouts random phrases as you walk by!
( I wanted to play around with a lua script here, and I'm happy with the results! He still needs a bit of work, but looking good so far! )
1 LaserDiode, 2 Circuit Boards, 2 Durasteel

A Monolith: it's so mysterious...
10 Obsidian

Recipes in the crafting table.
Lots of plans for the future! Feedback /Help welcome! 

To do:
  - Reduce lag in HAL scan
  - Armor
  - Random encounter: Dream/Trip Monolith room


Licensing for all art falls under fair use, as it is too pixelated to reproduce.. it's also all a big joke. ha.
